This is the Loci version of LULESH.  Loci assembles a parallel code
from a set of rules that are attached to serial code sections.  Since
Loci provides a rule-based matching of algorithm to computing resources,
it can expose parallelism more easily than many other programming models.

To setup the grid for this case:

make grid_setup
./grid_setup > test.grd
plot3d2vog -o -m test


The above program sets up the grid in file test.vog, while the provided
test.vars file specifies the boundary conditions.

The files are divided out as follows:

main.loci  // main driver
elem.loci  // element computations
node.loci  // node computations
timestep.loci // timestep computations
hydro.lh   // include file that defines loci types
varsFileInputs.loci // Defines default parameters that can be changed via .vars
grid_io.loci // defines output routines to save the grid in a form that 
             // can be extracted and visualized
utils.loci   // utility routines to convert finite volume data structures to
             // element based one.


lulesh is basically the first 6 files of above.  gridio can be
eliminated for performance tests, this will remove the gridfile output

to see the solution enter

extract -en test 1499 x

This will extract ensight files in the directory test_ensight.1499, you can visualize these files using paraview.


Some notes on methods for running the code:

Basic running in serial

./hydro test


Some optimization options to try out:

--memrandomized   This enables an experimental randomized greedy algorithm that
                  minimizies the memory footprint by optimizing intermediate
                  variable lifetimes.

--nochomp         This disables the chomping optimization

--scheduleoutput  Output generated schedule files in .schedule-<pnum>

--duplicate_work  Try to reduce number of synchronization points by replicating
                  work 

--verbose         Make the code output more information in .debug files.
